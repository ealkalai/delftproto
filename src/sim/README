1. What is this?
----------------
This code is a simple simulator for the Delft Proto Virtual Machine, that uses the Omnet++ classes.
You can load a specific script to the machine and run simulation through the Omnet++ IDE.

2. Compilation
---------------
In order to compile the code you need to have already install both the Delft Proto and the Omnet++

The Delft Proto can be found and installed via the following instructions:
	cd /tmp
	git clone git://github.com/delftproto/delftproto
	cd delftproto/vm
	./configure 
	sudo make install
	
You can find the Omnet++ from the following link:
	http://www.omnetpp.org/

After installing everything successfully, just enter:
	make
	
If no error appears you have installed the Delft Proto Simulator.

3. Run
------
To run the simulator press:
	./SimpleDelftSim

The Omnet++ simulation environment will open and then you can react with the available options.
Suggestion hit EXPRESS RUN (F7)

To change any parameters just open the SimpleDelftSim.net file and make any changes you want.
Change teh number of the Nodes
	node[NUMBER_OF_NODES]: Vm{...}
 
 

4. About The Code
------------------
Below it is a structure of files for the Simulator
	instructions				: Directory with new instructions
		plataform.cpp			: File that implements extra opCodes
	Sim_Machine				: Directory of the extension of the VM
		delftproto.instructions		: File with a list of the new instructions of the extension
		extension.hpp			: File that states what parts of the original VM will be extended
		instructions.cpp		: File with the implementatuin of the Opcodes of the extension
		machine.hpp			: File with the machine extension
		neighbour.hpp			: File with the Neighbour extension
	Makefile				: Script for the compilation of the source code
	script					: File that includes the Virtual machine script
	SimpleDelftSim.ned			: Ned File for the network Description
	extensions.hpp				: File that states the extenions of the Machine class
	machineid.hpp				: File that Overrides the original machineid.hpp file
	omnetpp.ini				: File with the network and running configuration
	vm.cpp					: File with the implementation of the Simulator Virtual Machine node

In order to integrate the virtual machine and the omnet++ a new extension was created. In the schema below you can see the model.

|Machine|		|cSimpleModule|

And when you in use your code Machine is like having a virtual machine which includes all the extensions of the Machine and also it is cSimpleModule, so you can interact with Omnet++ classes.
Each node in the omnet++ will be a Vm. The definition is in the vm.cpp file.
